# Dysregulation of Multiple Solute Carrier genes in metabolic Deficits in SLC1A4- Mutant Human iPSC Derived Dentate gyrus granule neurons

Deep learning benchmark for classifying dormant and proliferative metastatic breast tumor cells in a 3D BME model. Evaluates CNNs, segmentation networks, and transformers with transfer learning and temporal sequence modeling. EfficientNet-B7 achieved the best performance with 98.86% accuracy and ROC-AUC of 0.998.
